<h3>You can always count on me when</h3>
<p>You are feeling low, I will cheer you up</p>
<h4>One time in 6th grade we were at recess and while I was running to my friends, I just so happened to kick a HUGE rock (keep in mind, I was wearing flip-flops so it hurt like hell) and without thinking, I shouted at the top of my lungs "MOTHERFUCKER" And with my god-awful luck, my math teacher was sitting at the bench right BESIDE ME. He then took me inside to what I thought was yell at me, but he just could not stop laughing and sent me back outside with a literal candy bar. He is still my favorite teacher I've ever had.

<h5>I shouted a bad word in front of my teacher</h5>
